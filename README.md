# Project 1: Directory of SF GA Students

## Overview
GA Connect is a directory of student information for GA immersive students. Using the Twitter OAuth api, this app will pull in a students photo and recent tweets when they provide a public handle.

## Motivation

GA Connect was dreamed up while talking to UXDI students at a GA happy hour.After chatting a while we started to imagine what it would be like if we had a way to connect with other GA Immersive students outside of happy hours.

What if there were a tool where you could learn more about other students? Where you could read about their background and see samples of their work? How great of a reference would that be if you needed help on a future project. With these questions in mind, I decided to build GA Connect for my first WDI project.
